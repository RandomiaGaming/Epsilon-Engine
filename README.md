# Epsilon-Engine
Epsilon Engine is and open source game engine built using C# and .Net Core. Epsilon Engine is built off of the idea that game engines should work like legos. In Epsilon Engine almost every game system is made into a module which means that weather you want 2D or 3D, pixel art or high resolution, mobile, console, or PC Epsilon Engine supports it all. To create a game using Epsilon Engine we recomend starting by cloning this repository then add the modules that you need to the Modules folder. Finally you can start working on your very own game. All of Epsilon Engines code is cross platform which means if you want a console game or maybe a mobile game all you have to do is include the right driver modules. The modules folder currently contains all of the offically supported moduels but in the future these modules will move to their own repositories. If you like Epsilon Engine consider giving it a star, and if you have any feature requests or find bug the please feel free to create an issue.
